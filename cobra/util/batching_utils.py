Core definitions of (Distributed) Samplers for VLM finetuning; provides functionality for construction and allocating
"split-modality" batches as described in the LLaVa paper; this makes sure that a given device/batch is either entirely
(vision, language) or (language-only) data, which leads to sizeable efficiency gains.

        #
        # At this point in the code, `mm_sorted_batch_idxs` might then look like the following (length in parenthesis):

        #       [4  (91), 3  (21), 0  (20), 5  (18)]    => Batch 1

        #   ]
        #
        # In practice: `g_bsz` is large (= 128), and for contiguous mini-batch "slices", length variance is low.

        # PROBLEM :: We want to split these "global batches" into equal-sized pieces, so that each "replica" (GPU)
        # sees a "mini-batch" of roughly the same sequence lengths; this is super useful for efficient training.

        # HOWEVER :: The default "access pattern" for splitting a large batch into mini-batches by a DistributedSampler
        # is akin to a "take every k" where `k` is equal to the number of replicas (GPUs) you're training on. Or, in
        # Python notation --> `rank_k_indices = flatten(mm_sorted_batch_idxs)[k::num_replicas].
        #
        # Naively translating this our example means each GPU (in our world of 2 total) sees the following indices
        # (grouped by "mini-batch" = `g_bsz / num_replicas` = 2 for convenience):
        #   => `rank_0_indices`: [ [4 (91), 0 (20)] =>> [6 (89), 7  (19)] =>> [8  (93), 1 (90)] ]
        #   => `rank_1_indices`: [ [3 (21), 5 (18)] =>> [9 (88), 11 (17)] =>> [10 (92), 2 (21)] ]
        #
        # We get lucky sometimes, but for the most part, each "mini-batch" has VASTLY DIFFERENT lengths! Bad!

        # FIX :: If we "undo" the access pattern with the following code and re-arrange the way we allocate batches
        # inside the __iter__ method below, we can allocate indices appropriately. Running the following code gives us
        # the following indices (grouped by "mini-batch" again for convenience):
        #   => `rank_0_indices`: [ [4 (91), 3 (21)] =>> [6  (89), 9 (88)] =>> [8 (93), 10 (92)] ]
        #   => `rank_1_indices`: [ [5 (18), 0 (20)] =>> [11 (17), 7 (19)] =>> [2 (21),  1 (90)] ]
